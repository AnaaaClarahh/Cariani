Lock me up and throw away the key

He knows how to get the best out of me

I'm no force for the world to see

Trade my whole life just to be



Tell nobody I control you

I broke you just to own you

They can't tell that I love you

'Cause you're loyal, baby

I love when you're submissive

You love it when I break skin

You feel pain without flinchin'

So say it



Give me tough love

Leave me with nothin' when I come down

My kind of love

Push me and choke me 'til I pass out



We don't gotta be in lovе, no

I don't gotta be the one, no

I just wanna bе one of your girls tonight

We don't gotta be in love, no

I don't gotta be the one, no

I just wanna be one of your girls tonight, oh-oh-oh



Push me down, hold me down

Spit in my mouth while you turn me out

I wanna take your light inside

Tear me down, snuff me out

Hands on my neck while you push it up

And I'm screamin' out



Give me tough love

Leave me with nothin' when I come down

My kind of love

Force me and choke me 'til I pass out



We don't gotta be in love, no

I don't gotta be the one, no

I just wanna be one of your girls tonight (Tonight)

We don't gotta be in love, no

I don't gotta be the one, no (Oh)

I just wanna be one of your girls tonight, oh-oh-oh



Lock me up and throw away the key

He knows how to get the best out of me

I'm no force for the world to see

Trade my whole life just to be

Top of the world but I'm still not free

This is a secret that I keep

Until it's gone, I can never find peace

Waste my whole life just to be



We don't gotta be in love, no

I don't gotta be the one, no

I just wanna be one of your girls tonight (Tonight)

We don't gotta be in love, no

I don't gotta be the one, no (Oh)

I just wanna be one of your girls tonight (Oh) , oh-oh-oh
